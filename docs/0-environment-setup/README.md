# Level 0: Setting up UEFI Exploitation Environment

Welcome to DVUEFI!
Before we can begin exploring UEFI vulnerabilities, we must setup our environment.
1. First, we need to make sure we have the toolchain to build EDKII: the UEFI firmware development environment
2. Build an EDKII firmware image with our hand-crafted vulnerabilities patched in
3. Set up an emulation environment (using either QEMU or VMWare Workstation).
4. Start Hacking!

We will guide you throughout this process!
